# WikiRacer

WikiRacer is a program that runs a **Wiki Race** to find a ladder of Wikipedia links that can take the user from the given starting page to the given ending page. This assignment is provided by Stanford University's CS106L course. Although I'm not a student or alumni of Stanford university, this is my implementation of the WikiRacer that I did for fun!

## Installation

To run this program, you need Qt Creator installed with MinGW compiler, and an Internet connection. If the program fails, try installing OpenSSL and re-run.
